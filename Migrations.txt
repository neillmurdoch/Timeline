Create a migration:

dotnet ef migrations add Initial -p Timeline.Data -s Timeline.Api -v

Apply a migration:

This should work from the Timeline.Data folder, but doesn't:

dotnet ef database update -v

Running Update-Database from Package Manager Console having set the folder to Timeline.Data does work.
